# In-SSS
## Overview
Stochastic computing is crucial for accurate and efficient processing of massive data in advanced artificial intelligence applications. This project used the MNIST task as an example to demonstrate the advantages of the **in-situ stochastic computing** based on the In-SSS (Corresponding to **Noisy DropConnect** method).
## Requirements
This project requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations. It has been tested on the following environment:
- Windows 11
- RAM: 32 GB
- CPU: 8 cores (3.30 GHz/core)
- tensorflow 2.6.0
> **Note:** The runtimes below are generated using a computer with the above specs.
## Installation Guide
You can use pip to install the required python packages in PyCharm through the command line interface.
For example, to install the numpy package, you can use:
``pip install numpy``
which will install in about a few minutes.
## Usage
You can run all programs like this:
```
python 3 LeNet_This work.py
...
```
> **Note:** The model is quite small, so it will take just several minutes to finish the training procedure.
